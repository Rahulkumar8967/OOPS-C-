list of Managers of a Company having details such as Name, Age, etc..).
4.
Write a Program to find Maximum out of Two Numbers using friend function.

other class.
5. Write a Program to swap private data members of classes named as class_1, class_2 using
friend function.
6.
Write a Program to design a class complex to represent complex numbers. The complex
class should use an external function (use it as a friend function) to add two complex number
the function should return an object of type complex representing the sum of two complex
no.
7. Write a Program using copy constructor to copy data of an object to another object.
8. Write a Program to allocate memory dynamically for an objects of a given class using classâ€™s
constructor.
9. Write a Program to design a class to represent a matrix. The class should have the
functionality to insert and retrieve the elements of the matrix.
10. Write a program to design a class representing complex no. and having the functionality of
performing addition & multiplication of two complex numbers using operator overloading.
11. Write a Program to overload operators like *, <<, >> using friend function. The following
overloaded operators should work for a class vector.
12.
Write a program for developing a matrix class which can handle integer matrices of different
dimensions. Also overload the operator for addition, multiplication & comparison of
matrices.
13. Write a program to overload new/delete operators in a class.
14. Write a program in C++ to highlight the difference between overloaded assignment operator
and copy constructor.
15.
Write a Program illustrating how the constructors are implemented and the order in which
they are called when the classes are inherited. Use three classes named alpha, beta, gamma
such that alpha, beta are base class and gamma is derived class inheriting alpha & beta

Write a Program to design a student class representing student roll no. and a test class
(derived class of student) representing the scores of the student in various subjects and sports
class representing the score in sports. The sports and test class should be inherited by a result
class having the functionality to add the scores and display the final result for a student.
17. Write a program to maintain the records of person with details (Name and Age) and find the
eldest among them. The program must use this pointer to return the result.

class should have the functionality for adding new item, issuing, deposit etc. the program
should use the runtime polymorphism.
21. Write a program to show conversion from string to int and vice-versa.
22. Write a program showing data conversion between objects of different classes.
23. Write a program showing data conversion between objects of different classes and
conversion routine should reside in destination class.
